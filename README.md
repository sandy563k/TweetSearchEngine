# TweetSearchEngine
The project aim is to gain experience of building an end-to-end IR solution which provides wide-range of knowledge about a particular topic, including relevant tweets and analysis results. We started with collecting twitter data based on social issues( social unrest, politics, environment & crime) across five different cities (NYC, Mexico city, Paris, New Delhi & Bangkok). The language of the tweets also ranges in these 5 city specific languages.  Then we created the BM25  Solr schema and indexed the corpus of tweets. We improved the IR System Performance using query parsing and various other query boosting techniques. Post that, we created a Web stack which would display the query results along with analytics. Finally We performed Time series analysis, Comparison across the cities, Sentiment analysis and  Faceted search to build a solution that provides insight related to social conversations on important societal issues
